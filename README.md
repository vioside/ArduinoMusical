Musical Actions for Arduino
===========================

Turn on a number of ports specified in the array based on a number of musical notes (also specified in an array).

Can be used in many use-cases, for example turning on LEDs synched with music.

Only works with whole, quarter, half and eight notes so far, no triples.

Usage
-----

Set the notes array and the tempo variable.

The program is written using the PlatformIO framework. If you would like to extract the Arduino code as a standalone, you can find this at /src/main.cpp.
